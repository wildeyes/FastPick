Fast Pick provides keyboard shortcuts for search.
The chorme extension adds numbers to search results so you can press the appropriate number on you keyboard to select the search result you need.

Inspired by [Vimium](http://vimium.github.io/).

You'll browse faster. And it's intuitive. Really. You won't realize it's there until you're on your friend's computer.
